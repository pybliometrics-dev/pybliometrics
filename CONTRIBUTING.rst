1. Fork the `scopus` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/scopus.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
